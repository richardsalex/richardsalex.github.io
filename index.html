                <p>I'm Alex Richards, a reporter at <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com">NerdWallet</a>. I'm part of a small team dedicated to telling consumer finance stories that are in the public's interest. You can find out more about me and my work on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-richards">LinkedIn</a>; I'm a former Chicago Tribune reporter and was a <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/marshall-allen-and-alex-richards">finalist for the Pulitzer prize</a> in 2011.</p>
                <p>If you'd like to get in touch with me, I welcome any and all news tips. I protect my sources, but I want to make sure any contact that occurs and any information you provide happens through means that minimize your risk.</p>

                    <h3>Email and messaging apps</h3>
                    <p>My email address is <a href="mailto:arichards@nerdwallet.com"><strong>arichards@nerdwallet.com</strong></a>, and it's probably the easiest way to reach me.</p>
                    <p>My PGP fingerprint is <strong>B235 BB97 C515 FEF7 3D5E  928F F537 2A54 E1B1 A4D3</strong>. You can also <a href="/alex_richards_B235BB97C515FEF73D5E928FF5372A54E1B1A4D3.asc">download my public key</a>. PGP (short for "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">Pretty Good Privacy</a>") encrypts the content of the message so that only the recipient can see it, but it does not obscure the sender or receiver's email address.</p>
                    <p>For secure messaging that's encrypted end-to-end, I can be reached using <a href="https://whispersystems.org/">Signal</a> or <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a> at <strong><a href="tel:+17026064519">+1 (702) 606-4519</a></strong>. It's worth noting that these services also secure voice calls if you'd prefer to chat that way.</p>
